    <p> We start with the orthography because it is an important guide that forms the 
        foundation of the modern writing system for Louisiana Creole (LC). We will review 
        and practice the important concepts from the guide here but it is highly suggested 
        you read the guide in it's entirety: </p>

     <p>
        I feel it is important to note here that before the orthography there were other
         stages of convention for writing Louisiana Creole (LC). Since LC is a vernacular
          language the written word varies from person to person. Early text 
          (19th century court documents, newspaper personals, books, etc...) 
          were written as close to French as possible. Some good resources where you will
          see this is in the books <url href="https://www.editionstintamarre.com/catalogue/gazet">Kréyol dan la Gazèt by Taalib Pierre-Auguste</url>, <url href="https://archive.org/details/b24865424">Louisiana Folk Tales in French and English by Fortier</url>,
          <url href="https://archive.org/details/louisianacreoled0000brou">Louisiana Creole Dialect by Broussard</url>,
           and various dissertations from <url href="https://repository.lsu.edu/gradschool_disstheses/index.80.html#year_1937">Louisiana State University</url> 
        (the last 6 or so on the page in the link). </p>
        
        <p> In more recent times Creole orthographies from other French Creole languages were used to adopt a more uniform approach to
         writing, specifically the <url href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haitian_Creole/Alphabet">Haitian Creole Orthography</url>.
          <url href="https://cls.louisiana.edu/dictionary-louisiana-cr%C3%A9ole/30319">The Dictionary of Louisiana Creole</url>,
           one of the best resources available, is written using this orthography. Currently you 
         will often see individuals mixing the Haitian Orthography and the current orthography
        together since The Dictionary of Louisiana Creole is such an important source of
         information for us. The <url href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/518896926">anki spaced-repetition flashcard deck</url> linked in the front matter of
          this workbook contains all of the entries from the Dictionary and is <em>extremely</em> helpful for building vocabulary in LC.
