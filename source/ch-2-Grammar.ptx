  <title>Grammar</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> In my opinion the best way to learn a language is to learn the
         grammar rules and then build your vocabulary. We can practice 
        reading and writing in this workbook but not listening and speaking. </p>
    
    <p>  Make sure to practice these skills on your own by talking to other speakers (our yourself)
         and finding resources to listen to. If you find it hard to find material to listen
        to I suggest listening to Louisiana French as there are more resources available to find
    and it can help you get an ear for both languages since many pronunciations are the same or very similar. </p>
