<title>Basic Sentence Structure</title>


<p>
    Basic sentence structure for Louisiana Creole is SVO just like in English:
</p>


          
        <tabular>
            <row halign="center">
                <cell><em> subject + verb + object </em></cell>
            </row>
        </tabular>
    


<p> </p>

<p></p>


<p>
    Subject is what we are talking about. It can be a noun or a pronoun. 
</p>

<p>
    We will discuss verbs and tenses in a later section. 
</p>

<p>
    Object is a noun or pronoun that receives or is the target of the subject. 
</p>


    <example>
   <p> Example: The ball rolls down the hill.
</p>
</example>

<solution>
<p>
    Subject: ball
</p>

<p>
    Verb: rolls
</p>

<p>
    Object: hill
</p>

<p>
    down is used as an adverb since it modifies the verb "rolls".
</p>
</solution>

<p>
    In LC the example sentence above would be: Laplòt roulé enba koto.
</p>

<p>
    A general rule for speaking in LC is to leave out any unnecessary information. 
    Many prepositions are left out of sentences if they can be implied. Notice we don't use a
    "the" term for the hill (koto) or ball (laplòt) since it adds no additional information to
     the sentence.  "The" would only be necessary if there were several hills or balls present and we needed to specify a 
    certain one or group.
</p>

<p>
    Post-nominal determinaers are little words or phrases we add to the end of a noun to indicate
    plural and specifics. Think about it as when we say "the", the term for "the" goes at the end.
    We can use the standard French form of "la" in front of a noun as well.
</p>

<example>
 <p>la shyin and shyin-la both mean "the dog". </p>
</example>

 <solution>
   <p> The first is a more acrolectal form (Fr) and the second
  is more basilectal (LC). </p>
  </solution>
