    <title>IPA Vowel Chart</title>
        <p> It is ok to skip this section, however, familiarity with it will help you
             get through some of the upcoming problems easier.  </p>


            <p> We will be learning how to use the IPA Chart.</p>  

<p></p>

           <p> <em><insert> Vowels</insert></em> </p>



<p> For vowels two things to consider is rounded vs. un-rounded:

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            A rounded vowel is made when you pucker your lips like when you make the
             sound "oooo". 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            An un-rounded is when your lips are not puckered as in the sound "eeeeeee".
        </p>
    </li>
</ul></p>
         

<p></p>


<p>When using the IPA for vowels we are concerned with the position of the tongue.</p>


<p>Front vs. Back:
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            The sound  "eeeeeeee" is made with your tongue in the front most part
             of your mouth for vowels (towards the lips)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The sound "awwwww" is made with your tongue in the back most part of
             your mouth for vowels (tongue is drawn back)
        </p>
    </li>
</ul> </p>
    

    

<p>Top vs. Bottom:

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            The vowel part of "bluueeeeeee" is in the top most part of the mouth for
             vowels (close position)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The vowel part of "haaaaaaaaah" is in the bottom most part of the mouth 
            for vowels (open position)
        </p>
    </li>
</ul></p>
    



<p>All vowels live within the boundaries created by these utmost top, bottom, front and back 
positions. The chart for the vowels of the IPA is made by modeling the position of the 
tongue within these same boundaries.  </p>

<p>Note that when there are two symbols next to each other in the vowel chart, the symbol
 on the right represents the exact same sound as the symbol on the left but rounded. </p>
 
 
<p> So for example, [i], which makes the "ee" sound in "see", has the same tongue placement as [y], which makes the "ew" sound in "chew". [i] is called the close front unrounded vowel and [y] is the closed front rounded vowel. </p>


<p> The heights, from bottom to top of the mouth are labeled as:
    <ul>
        <li><p><em>open</em></p></li>
        <li><p>near-open</p></li>
        <li><p><em>open-mid</em></p></li>
        <li><p>mid</p></li>
        <li><p><em>close-mid</em></p></li>
        <li><p>near-close</p></li>
        <li><p><em>close</em></p></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p> The emphasized terms above are the levels where most of the vowels are formed. </p>


<p> The intermediary positions contain less vowels. [æ] for instance is between 
    the open and open-mid positions. It is in the near-open or near-low level.
</p>



<p> The positions, from throat to lips are labeled as:
    <ul>
        <li><p>back</p></li>
        <li><p>central</p></li>
        <li><p>front</p></li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p>Revisiting our [æ] example, we would call it the near-open front 
    unrounded vowel or near-low front unrounded vowel.

<p>Voiced vs un-voiced (s v.s z):</p>



<p>Voiced means that your vocal cords are vibrating. If you place your hand on your throat you should feel a vibration. Say "zzzzzzzzz" and you should notice that your throat is vibrating. "z" is the voiced version of "s".  
 [ʒ] is the voiced version of [ʃ].</p>
