<title>Nasalized Vowels</title>
                
<p>
    Nasalized vowels are the same vowels we learned in the previous section, <xref ref="subsec-1-1-1-Tables" />, 
    but nasalized. This means that the consonant next to the nasalized vowel is only partially pronounced. 
    Nasalized vowels are identified by a tilda, ~ , as a little hat on top of the vowel. </p>
    
<p> [ɑ̃] represents the nasalized form of [a]. When a vowel is nasalized we "half" pronounce the consonant that follows it.
    An example would be the French word "bon" which means good. You probably read that with a hard "n" at the end
     (ending with the same sound made by "nnnnn"). In French, and LC, the "n" would not be fully sounded, 
     your tongue floats in your mouth the whole time and never touches the top of your mouth at the end. 
     We let are tongue get as close as we can to touching the top of our mouth without actually touching. 
     You can think of it as more like saying "<m>baw^n</m>" where you are almost pronouncing the "n" at the end. 
     We are trying to say "bon" as much as possible without pronouncing the actual "n". </p>
    
<p> Our first form of bon, pronounced with the hard "n", would have ipa [bɔn], the nasalized version would have ipa [bɔ̃]. </p>
    
<p>You can determine if you are pronouncing a nasalized vowel correctly or not by pinching your nose with your fingers. 
    If the sound gets blocked it is being nasalized.  Nasalized vowels in LC have no equivalent in English. </p>


     <p> The nasalized vowels in LC occur when a vowel "a", "e", "i", or "o" occur before the consonants "n" or "m".
                        There is a marker we put over one of these vowels when they precede an "n" or "m" but are not nasalized, 
                        we will discuss these accent marks later in this section.
                   </p>
                   <p> To summarize, whenever we see "an", "am", "en", "em", "in", "im", "on", or "om" when reading LC the vowel is nasalized
                    and the consonant is barely pronounced. </p>

<p> A quick few things of importance:</p>
    <ul>    
        <li>
            <p> There is a special case of "inn" and "imm". Whenever we see this combination of three letters 
                    the pronunciation is [in], <m>een</m>,  and [im], <m>eem</m>, respectively.  </p>
     </li>
        <li>
               <p>
                This creates a problem since "in" and "im" give us the nasalized [ɛ̃] and [ɛ̃], respectively,
                and there are times when we need to represent [ɛ̃n] and [ɛ̃m].</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p> We use "ènn" and "èmm" when we need to represent [ɛ̃n] and [ɛ̃m], respectively.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> "u" is a special case, we do not generally use the nasalization when u is paired with "n" or "m"
                but if we do, "un" and "um" would be [œ̃].
                
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
