  <title>Reading, Writing and Speaking Kouri Vini</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> In order to read, write and speak in Kouri Vini we should first be
     familiar with the current orthography, the spelling system being used. We will
     start the lesson by going over the IPA, international phonetic alphabet, needed
     for Kouri Vini.
    The IPA is an international standard for writing a symbol to represent as many
     sounds as a human can make with their mouth when communicating. We are only
      interested in a small subset of symbols to be able to represent Kouri Vini. </p>
