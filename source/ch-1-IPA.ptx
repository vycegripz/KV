      In order to read, write and speak in Louisiana Creole we should first be
     familiar with the current orthography, the spelling system we use. We will
     start the chapter by first going over the IPA, international phonetic alphabet, 
     and then using that understanding to become familiar with our orthography. Once 
     the orthography is understood we can then talk about reading, writing and 
     speaking in Louisiana Creole.

    <p> The <em>IPA</em> is an international standard for writing a symbol to represent any
     sound a human can make with their mouth when communicating. We are only
      interested in a small subset of symbols to be able to represent Louisiana Creole. </p>
