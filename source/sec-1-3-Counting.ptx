    <p>
        We will learn how to write and pronounce the different numbers for Louisiana Creole.
         Note that there are many dialects of Louisiana Creole and it would be impossible to capture
         everything here. As such, when there are multiple ways to pronounce the same word I 
         will put the IPA but not the LC spelling differences. It is up to the reader to understand
         how the variation would be written. Remember the general rules from <xref ref="subsec-1-2-2-alphabet-generalities"/>
         to help guide you.</p>

         <p> An example of this is "de" (two) in the next subsection <xref ref="subsec-1-3-1-vocab"/>. 
            The IPA provided for it is [dø, de] but I did not write the entry for two as "de, dé". 
            Some words can have up to 10 variations or more, some more similar to others
            (we saw this in one of the example problems <xref ref="subsec-1-2-3-examples"/>), and 
            I don't want to bog this reader/workbook down with focusing on the variation. Therefore, 
            variations that are very different from each other will be noted with their IPA.</p>
        
        <p>
        Another notation that you will see is letters in a word in parenthesis. This is to help designate 
        other spellings of the same word. For instance, for 4 you will see kat(r). This is
        because we use "kat" if the next word after it in a sentence starts with a consonant and "katr" if 
        the next word starts with a vowel. It is <em>not</em> the case that parenthesis are always used according
        to a potential liaison (blending of ending consonant of one word with beginning vowel of the next
         as seen in French) or not.
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance the word "(la)sal(i)té" has been documented as being pronounced/spelled as lasalité,
         lasalté, salité and as salté.
    
    </p>

    <p>
        If you see terms separated backslash inside parenthesis then that means
        any of the terms in the parenthesis are valid as well. For instance "(l/n/z)ami" means that
        lami, nami, zami and ami are all commonly used words/variations.
