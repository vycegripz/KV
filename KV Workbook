<!--This is where I will be keeping any notes that i need to make along the way. 

To Do: 

Make 2 videos for each section, one for content and one to do the problem sets.

    1. Make one more problem for 1.1 for matching words and their IPA
    2. Posiibly make one more of each question but without any distractor type pieces (scaffolding)
    3. add IPA Chart to 1.1 and Q#2 as hint
    4. Make a links section
    5. Make a list of student outcomes at the start of the section
    6. 1.2 Orthography 
       1.3 numbers
       1.4 Shapes
    7. 1.2.4 is a special section for KV specifics, ç, ay, ai, inn, ènn, ànn, ònn
       Same rule as with nasals, all accented vowels are non-nasalized ...?
    8. In generalities section of 1.2 talk about each vowel in general
    9. 
    10. 1.2.4-accented with double n or m is non-nasalized, not-accented is nasalized except for inn

Almost all en, em, etc is nasalized and blends with next n/m except for inn/imm and ann/amm (not going to put the a's)
ènn replaces missing [ɛ̃n] or [ɛ̃m] we need to be able to write.

all accented are non nasalized except for
    ènn is special case for all accents are non-nasaled
    inn is special case case for all non-accents are nasaled

1. SLOs should go in the section introduction

1. Add a slow building reading piece into each section
2. AI pictures
