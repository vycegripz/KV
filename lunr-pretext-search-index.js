Key Consonant Sounds    IPA Symbol  English Approximation  English Example    [j]  y  y ou, be y ond, b eau tiful    [tʃ]  ch  ch ur ch     [dʒ]  j  j am, gy m, sol di er, bri dge     [ʒ]  zh  mer g e, trea su re, vi si on Note: Think of saying \"jjjjjump\"    [ʃ]  sh  sh are, na ti on, spe ci al    [ɲ]  ny  ca ny on, jalape ñ o       IPA Vowel Chart  It is ok to skip this section, however, familiarity with it will help you get through some of the upcoming problems easier.  We will be learning how to use the IPA Chart.    Vowels   For vowels two things to consider is rounded vs. un-rounded:   A rounded vowel is made when you pucker your lips like when you make the sound \"oooo\".    An un-rounded is when your lips are not puckered as in the sound \"eeeeeee\".     When using the IPA for vowels we are concerned with the position of the tongue.  Front vs. Back:   The sound \"eeeeeeee\" is made with your tongue in the front most part of your mouth for vowels (towards the lips)    The sound \"awwwww\" is made with your tongue in the back most part of your mouth for vowels (tongue is drawn back)     Top vs. Bottom:   The vowel part of \"bluueeeeeee\" is in the top most part of the mouth for vowels (close position)    The vowel part of \"haaaaaaaaah\" is in the bottom most part of the mouth for vowels (open position)    All vowels live within the boundaries created by these utmost top, bottom, front and back positions. The chart for the vowels of the IPA is made by modeling the position of the tongue within these same boundaries.      Note that when there are two symbols next to each other in the vowel chart, the symbol on the right represents the exact same sound as the symbol on the left but rounded.  So for example, [i], which makes the \"ee\" sound in \"see\", has the same tongue placement as [y], which makes the \"ew\" sound in \"chew\". [i] is called the close front unrounded vowel and [y] is the closed front rounded vowel.  The heights, from bottom to top of the mouth are labeled as:  open  near-open  open-mid  mid  close-mid  near-close  close    The emphasized terms above are the levels where most of the vowels are formed.  The intermediary positions contain less vowels. [æ] for instance is between the open and open-mid positions. It is in the near-open or near-low level.  The positions, from throat to lips are labeled as:  back  central  front    Revisiting our [æ] example, we would call it the near-open front unrounded vowel or near-low front unrounded vowel.  You can visit the Wikipedia site below to see an interactive version of this chart. If you click on the symbol it will play the sound for you:  IPA vowel chart with audio  The site below does a good job of explaining the IPA even further than I will get into here.  IPA Crash Course   Consonants  Voiced vs un-voiced (s v.s z):  Voiced means that your vocal cords are vibrating. If you place your hand on your throat you should feel a vibration. Say \"zzzzzzzzz\" and you should notice that your throat is vibrating. \"z\" is the voiced version of \"s\". [ʒ] is the voiced version of [ʃ].    Examples  Let's show how this works with some simple examples in English. Any symbol that gets shown in square brackets for an IPA pronunciation guide gets sounded, nothing remains silent.

  "body": " Orthography    What's Covered  After completing this section you should be at least some what familiar with:  The orthograpy for Kouri Vini   nasalized vowels    accents    How to apply the orthography       We start with the orthography because it is an important guide that forms the foundation of the modern writing system for Louisiana Creole (LC). We will review and practice the important concepts from the guide here but it is highly suggested you read the guide in it's entirety:   Kouri Vini: A Guide to Louisiana Creole Orthography   I feel it is important to note here that before the orthography there were other stages of convention for writing Louisiana Creole (LC). Since LC is a vernacular language the written word varies from person to person. Early text (19th century court documents, newspaper personals, books, etc...) were written as close to French as possible. Some good resources where you will see this is the books Kréyol dan la Gazèt by Taalib Pierre-Auguste , Louisiana Folk Tales in French and English by Fortier , Louisiana Creole Dialect by Broussard , and various dissertations from Louisiana State University (the last 6 or so on the page in the link). In more recent times Creole orthographies from other French Creole languages have were used to adopt a more uniform approach to writing, specifically the Haitian Creole Orthography . The Dictionary of Louisiana Creole , one of the best resources available, is written using this orthography. Currently you will often see individuals mixing the Haitian Orthography and the current orthography together since The Dictionary of Louisiana Creole is such an important source of information for us. The anki deck linked in the front matter of this workbook contains all of the entries from the Dictionary and is extremely helpful for building vocabulary.   Nasalized Vowels  Nasalized vowels are the same vowels we learned in the previous section, , but nasalized. This means that the consonant next to the nasalized vowel is only partially pronounced. Nasalized vowels are identified by a tilda, ~ , as a little hat on top of the vowel.  [ɑ̃] represents the nasalized form of [a]. When a vowel is nasalized we \"half\" pronounce the consonant that follows it. An example would be the French word \"bon\" which means good. You probably read that with a hard \"n\" at the end (ending with the same sound made by \"nnnnn\"). In French, and Kouri Vini, the \"n\" would not be fully sounded, your tongue floats in your mouth the whole time and never touches the top of your mouth at the end. We let are tongue get as close as we can to touching the top of our mouth without actually touching. You can think of it as more like saying \" \" where you are almost pronouncing the \"n\" at the end. We are trying to say \"bon\" as much as possible without pronouncing the actual \"n\".  Our first form of bon, pronounced with the hard \"n\", would have ipa [bɔn], the nasalized version would have ipa [bɔ̃].  You can determine if you are pronouncing a nasalized vowel correctly or not by pinching your nose with your fingers. If the sound gets blocked it is being nasalized. Nasalized vowels in Kouri Vini have no equivalent in English.  The nasalized vowels in KV occur when a vowel \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\" or \"u\" occur before the consonants \"n\" or \"m\". There is a marker we put over one of these vowels when they precede an \"n\" or \"m\" but are not nasalized, we will discuss these accent marks later in this section.  To summarize, whenever we see \"an\", \"am\", \"en\", \"em\", \"in\", \"im\", \"on\", \"om\", \"un\" or \"um\" when reading KV the vowel is nasalized and the consonant is barely pronounced.   Nasalized Vowel Sounds    KV  IPA  English Approx.    an  [ɑ̃]     am  [ɑ̃]     en  [ɑ̃]     em  [ɑ̃]     in  [ɛ̃]     im  [ɛ̃]     on  [ɔ̃]     om  [ɔ̃]     un  [œ̃]     um  [œ̃]      A quick few things of importance:    There is a special case of \"inn\" and \"imm\". Whenever we see this combination of three letters the pronunciation is [in], , and [im], , respectively.    This creates a problem since \"in\" and \"im\" give us the nasalized [ɛ̃] and [ɛ̃], respectively, and there are times when we need to represent [ɛ̃n] and [ɛ̃m].    We use \"ènn\" and \"èmm\" when we need to represent [ɛ̃n] and [ɛ̃m], respectively.    Let's go over a few examples for how to pronounce Kouri Vini words using the IPA.
